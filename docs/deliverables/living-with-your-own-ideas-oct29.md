## Prototypes to "become something else" 

**Trashcan Prosthesis**

The Trashcan Prosthesis lets me become my trashcan and feel the “hidden” impact of what I throw away. A small pouch on my back, attached to a necklace, gains weight proportional to my waste, growing heavier and more uncomfortable over time. By physically carrying what I discard, I become aware of the tangible impact concealed in the convenience of throwing things “away.”

## Next Steps

I'd like to iterate on revealed responsibilities. I really like the idea of revealing impacts through prosthetics. There are so many actions we take that have downstream effects that we intellectually know are harmful, yet we do them anyway. My hypothesis is that one reason for this is because the knowledge is not embodied. We have no physical sensation of what they effects are. By revealing these things and having some sort of embodied effect, I think we could facilitate more intentional behaviors.
