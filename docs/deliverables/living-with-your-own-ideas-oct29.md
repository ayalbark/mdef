## Prototypes to "become something else" 

**Trashcan Prosthesis**

The Trashcan Prosthesis lets me become my trashcan and feel the hidden impact of what I throw away. A small pouch on my back gains weight proportional to the amount of trash in the can, growing heavier and more uncomfortable over time.

## Next Steps

Yesterday Manel De Aguas made a distinction between Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and Revealed Reality. He described Revealed Reality as using tech to reveal what is *already* there. 

In that vein, I'd like to iterate on the idea of revealed responsibilities/revealed impacts. How could we design prostheses so that they reveal "hidden" downstread impacts of our actions?

There are so many actions we take that we know have harmful effects, yet we do them anyway. I think one reason for this is because the knowledge is not embodied. We have no physical sensation of what the effects are. By revealing a representation of the effects with prothesis through some sort of embodied effect, I think we could facilitate more intentional behaviors.
