## Dance Class

For a moment or two  
I knew  
The feeling of  
weightlessness  
Of utter disregard  
For the eyes outside  
My own  

If only for a moment  
You taught me  
To love is to live  
And to live is to  
Let yourself die  
In one hundred  
Little ways 

Each day  
So when you dance  
You're not weighed  
Down by the thoughts  
You don't need  

It's better to walk  
on the beach  
by yourself  
or in good company  
and throw little rocks  
onto the sand  
in front of you  
and watch the water  
wash them away.


## Toni 
Four years ago I sat in my living room  
staring at my mom.  
Her black and gray mane of hair laid silently  
with a purple daffodil behind her ear.  

Four weeks earlier we had been dancing  
in the same exact room,  
in the same exact spot,  
Sans medical equipment and hospital bed.  

The floor still remembered our steps.  
And I could see her swaying side to side,  
Spinning in circles while her dress  
Tried to keep up.  

Four years ago I sat wondering  
if I had ever seen my mom so still.  
She paraglided over the French Alps.  
She biked the Great Wall of China.  
She belly danced through medical school.  

And here she was,  
Silent with the weight of death on her eyes,  
Beautiful as always.  
Persephone returning to the garden of Hades.  

Four years ago I sat and prayed  
that I would never forget the touch of her hand on my shoulder,  
that I would never forget the sound of her voice  
echoing through the house,  
that I would always remember her smile.  

The further one gets from death the more it feels  
like a postcard.  
The more it feels like it came from somewhere far away,  
by a hand other than your own.  
With a message written in ink that stains your fingers  
and the fingers of its author.  

Every once in a while I take the postcard out of my drawer  
and stare at it silently.  
It's written in a language I can't understand.  

On the other side of the postcard is a picture  
of the waves washing away the shore,  
and if I look close enough  
I can see something written in the sand.  
It's almost been washed away,  
but I can still feel the touch of her hand on my shoulder.


## Ambrosia 
There is nothing more satisfying  
In this world than sitting  
On a chair that is a tree stump  
On a sandy road in southern Mexico  
And hearing the machete  
Rain down upon the coconut’s husk  
While the sun boomerangs its ultraviolet  
Rays at your bare skin covered in  
Drying salt and a sprinkle of sand  
And you’re handed the cold coconut  
In exchange for thirty pesos,  
The last in your pocket, but it  
Doesn’t matter as the sweet juice  
Pours into your open mouth  

## Laws of Nature
You’re either eating or being eaten.  
You’re either fodder for the communal bonfire,  
Fuel for eternal entropy, or you’re  
Breaking down raw matter for protein synthesis.  

The snake eats its own tail not for the taste,  
But because there is no other food in a vacuum.  
Are you the mouth or are you the tail?  

Perhaps we’re both at once.  
Agents of destruction constructing new horizons  
From the ones that slowly rotate out of view.  
Fill your stomach and let us take a bite.
