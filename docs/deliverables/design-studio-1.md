# Design Studio 1 - October 20th

## Overview

This is my deliverable for Design Studio 1, due on October 20th. 

## Process Documentation

**1. Context & Motivation**

Personal observation: I often spend attention on my phone in ways that feel unaligned with how I want to be.

The phone functions as both a useful tool and an object of my attention. Often in a way that feels pathological.

Research goal: explore my phone as the object of attention through a first-person, data-driven approach.

**2. Research Design**

Approach: 1PP (first-person perspective), where I am both the subject and the researcher.

Duration: One week (October 11–18, 2025).

Method: Self-tracking experiment using a custom iPhone Shortcut to log contextual and intentional data every time I opened my phone.

Tools:

iPhone

Apple Shortcuts app

Google Sheets (for logging data)

Google My Maps (for visualization)

ChatGPT (for co-developing the Shortcut, uploading the map, and analyzing data; link to conversation for transparency and process documentation: https://chatgpt.com/share/68f4debd-4e98-8009-9876-495a71378d84).

**3. Data Collection Process**

Every time I opened my phone and ran the Shortcut, it automatically:

(1) Logged date and time.

(2) Logged GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude).

(3) Asked why I was using my phone (self-reported intent).

(4) Prompted me to take a photo of my immediate surroundings.

(5) 1/12 of the time: prompted for a video recording.

(6) 1/12 of the time: prompted for an audio recording.

(7) 1/12 of the time: waited 30 seconds, then, if I was still on my phone, prompted a screen recording.

**4. Data Processing**

After collecting data, I standardized the “why” column (e.g., “txt,” “text,” and “whatsapp” all categorized under “messaging”).

Uploaded the resulting data to Google My Maps, where each point on the map represented an instance of phone use.

Color coding was used to differentiate categories of “why.”

The final map served as a spatial visualization of attention, showing where and why I used my phone across the week.
