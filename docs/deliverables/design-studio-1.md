# Design Studio 1 - October 20th

## Overview

For one week, I logged every single time that I interacted with my phone in an attempt to get a deeper understanding of my phone as an object of my attention. Below is an interactive map that serves as a spatial visualization of this, showing where and why I used my phone across the week. Each pin represents an instance of phone use, and the pins are color coded by the reason why I opened my phone. Click the top left toggle to see the color code. The URL at the bottom of each pin is a photo of what my surroundings looked like when my attention went to my phone. 

Underneath the map is a short video essay I created made entirely of images, videos, audio, and songs that I captured immediately after opening my phone throughout the week. If you hear something, whether it is a random conversation or a bossa nova song, it was playing during a video, an audio recording, or while I was recording my screen.

## Process Documentation

**1. Context & Motivation**

In the Design Studio 1 course we were given this prompt: 

* Choose a context of interest (socio-bio-techno-political, both physical and/or digital, etc.). Develop a site-specific research methodology to study this context from a 1PP approach.
* Develop an audiovisual essay (90s), showing 50 images of your 1PP research defining the field of action of your context of interest
        * Explain your methodology: how, where, why

I had started that class by sharing this design bet: "Open-source, 3D-printed biofeedback devices for at-home attention training could increase attention span and sustained focus by 200% without medical intervention".

I didn't feel attached to the design bet, but using attention as my starting point I decided to explore the link between my attention and my phone. 

I feel like how I attend to my phone feels unaligned with how I want to be attending to my phone. My phone functions as a useful tool, but also as a black hole, sucking in my attention when I would rather it be elsewhere.

My research goal was to explore my phone as and object of my attention through a first-person, data-driven approach.

**2. Research Design**

Approach: 1PP (first-person perspective), where I was both the subject and the researcher.

Duration: One week (October 11–18, 2025).

Method: Self-tracking experiment using a custom iPhone Shortcut to log contextual and intentional data every single time I interacted with my phone, even if it was just to check the time.

**Tools I Used:**

- iPhone

- Apple Shortcuts app

- Attention Logger (the shortcut I created to collect the data)

- iCloud (for storing data)

- Google Sheets (for logging data)

- Google My Maps (for visualization)

- ChatGPT (for co-developing Attention Logger, uploading the map, and   analyzing data) 
  - Link to conversation for transparency and process documentation: https://chatgpt.com/share/68f4debd-4e98-8009-9876-495a71378d84

**3. Data Collection Process**

Every time I opened my phone and ran the Shortcut, it automatically:

**(1)** Logged the date and time.

**(2)** Logged my GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude).

**(3)** Asked why I was using my phone (which I then filled in manually).

**(4)** Prompted me to take a photo of my immediate surroundings.

**(5)** 1/12 of the time: prompted for a video recording.

**(6)** 1/12 of the time: prompted for an audio recording.

**(7)** 1/12 of the time: waited 30 seconds, then, if I was still on my phone, prompted a screen recording.

**4. Data Processing**

After a week of collecting data, I standardized the “why” column (e.g., “txt,” “text,” and “whatsapp” all categorized under “messaging”). Then, I 
uploaded the resulting data to Google My Maps, where each pin on the map represents an instance of phone use: https://www.google.es/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1Es_1ItoBFE1IKFXyBiMWJW_ZFmYa27k&ll=41.38895722155954%2C2.1959504136691166&z=15. The pins are color coded by the reason I opened my phone. The URL at the bottom of each pin is a photo of what my surroundings looked like when my attention went to my phone. 

The final map serves as a spatial visualization of attention, showing where and why I used my phone across the week. Feel free to look around!

Here is some birds-eye view data:

**5. Limitations**

Shortcut app did not always function properly (occasional failed runs for unknown reasons).

Required internet connection to log coordinates — failed or delayed on trains or airplane mode.

Manual activation meant I sometimes forgot to run it, especially early in the week.

Being both researcher and subject likely biased my behavior; the act of observation changed my phone use patterns.

Only logged instances of opening the phone, not duration of use.

Lacked data on secondary usage drift (e.g., opening for messaging, then doomscrolling).

Future iteration could check in at intervals (30s/1min) to capture evolving intent.

Google My Maps limitation: could not display inline images — only clickable URLs.

**6. Observations** 

I tried to prompt ChatGPT to process the data for me and get behavioral insights around my phone use. Unfortunately, it kept on crashing and I didn't have the time to run an excel script to parse through the spreadsheet before writing this. I think I'll go back to it if I have some free time later. 
 
“Messaging,” “Camera,” and “Clock” accounted for over 50% of total interactions.

Suggests potential benefit of transferring clock/messaging functions to a wearable (Apple Watch) to reduce random engagement.

“Calls” were among the least frequent uses.

“No reason” or “bored” ranked 5th — raises questions about spontaneous, unintentional attention use.

Tracking follow-up activity could clarify whether these instances led to more scattered usage patterns.
## Visual Documentation

- Messaging, Camera, and Clock accounted for more than 50% of the times my attention went to my phone. I've always hated the idea of an apple watch, but I wonder if using it for the clock and messaging functions would keep me off my phone, and thus less likely to start using it for random things.

- Using my phone to call was one of the lowest on there. That surprised me.

- Using my phone for "no reason" which also included "bored" was the 5th most common reason. I wish I was able to track usage after opening because I am curious if it also led to the most random usage afterwards
