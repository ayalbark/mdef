Poetry: Dance Class \u00b6 For a moment or two I knew The feeling of weightlessness Of utter disregard For the eyes outside My own If only for a moment You taught me To love is to live And to live is to Let yourself die In one hundred Little ways Each day So when you dance You\u2019re not weighed Down by the thoughts You don\u2019t need It\u2019s better to walk on the beach by yourself or in good company and throw little rocks onto the sand in front of you and watch the water wash them away. Toni \u00b6 Four years ago I sat in my living room staring at my mom. Her black and gray mane of hair laid silently with a purple daffodil behind her ear. Four weeks earlier we had been dancing in the same exact room, in the same exact spot, Sans medical equipment and hospital bed. The floor still remembered our steps. And I could see her swaying side to side, Spinning in circles while her dress Tried to keep up. Four years ago I sat wondering if I had ever seen my mom so still. She paraglided over the French Alps. She biked the Great Wall of China. She belly danced through medical school. And here she was, Silent with the weight of death on her eyes, Beautiful as always. Persephone returning to the garden of Hades. Four years ago I sat and prayed that I would never forget the touch of her hand on my shoulder, that I would never forget the sound of her voice echoing through the house, that I would always remember her smile. The further one gets from death the more it feels like a postcard. The more it feels like it came from somewhere far away, by a hand other than your own. With a message written in ink that stains your fingers and the fingers of its author. Every once in a while I take the postcard out of my drawer and stare at it silently. It\u2019s written in a language I can\u2019t understand. On the other side of the postcard is a picture of the waves washing away the shore, and if I look close enough I can see something written in the sand. It\u2019s almost been washed away, but I can still feel the touch of her hand on my shoulder. Ambrosia \u00b6 There is nothing more satisfying than sitting on a chair that is a tree stump on a sandy road in southern Mexico and hearing the machete rain down upon the coconut\u2019s husk while the sun boomerangs its ultraviolet rays at your bare skin covered in drying salt and a sprinkle of sand and you\u2019re handed the cold coconut in exchange for thirty pesos, the last in your pocket, but it doesn\u2019t matter as the sweet juice pours into your open mouth. Laws of Nature \u00b6 You\u2019re either eating or being eaten. You\u2019re either fodder for the communal bonfire, fuel for eternal entropy, or you\u2019re breaking down raw matter for protein synthesis. The snake eats its own tail not for the taste, but because there is no other food in a vacuum. Are you the mouth or are you the tail? Perhaps we\u2019re both at once. Agents of destruction constructing new horizons from the ones that slowly rotate out of view. Fill your stomach and let us take a bite.

Below is an interactive map that serves as a spatial visualization of this, showing where and why I used my phone across the week. Each pin represents an instance of phone use, and the pins are color coded by the reason why I opened my phone. Click the top left toggle to see the color code. The URL at the bottom of each pin is a photo of what my surroundings looked like when my attention went to my phone. Underneath the map is a short video essay I created made entirely of images, videos, audio, and songs that I captured immediately after opening my phone throughout the week. If you hear something, whether it is a random conversation or a bossa nova song, it was playing during a video, an audio recording, or while I was recording my screen. Interactive Map \u00b6 Video Essay \u00b6 Process Documentation \u00b6 1. Context & Motivation In the Design Studio 1 course we were given this prompt: Choose a context of interest (socio-bio-techno-political, both physical and/or digital, etc.). Develop a site-specific research methodology to study this context from a 1PP approach. Develop an audiovisual essay (90s), showing 50 images of your 1PP research defining the field of action of your context of interest * Explain your methodology: how, where, why I had started that class by sharing this design bet: \u201cOpen-source, 3D-printed biofeedback devices for at-home attention training could increase attention span and sustained focus by 200% without medical intervention\u201d. I didn\u2019t feel attached to the design bet, but using attention as my starting point I decided to explore the link between my attention and my phone. I feel like how I attend to my phone feels unaligned with how I want to be attending to my phone. My phone functions as a useful tool, but also as a black hole, sucking in my attention when I would rather it be elsewhere. My research goal was to explore my phone as and object of my attention through a first-person, data-driven approach. 2. Research Design Approach: 1PP (first-person perspective), where I was both the subject and the researcher. Duration: One week (October 11\u201318, 2025). Method: Self-tracking experiment using a custom iPhone Shortcut to log contextual and intentional data every single time I interacted with my phone, even if it was just to check the time. Tools I Used: iPhone Apple Shortcuts app Attention Logger (the shortcut I created to collect the data) iCloud (for storing data) Google Sheets (for logging data) Google My Maps (for visualization) ChatGPT (for co-developing Attention Logger, uploading the map, and analyzing data) Link to the conversation is in the \u201cLinks and Resources\u201d section at the bottom of the page. 3. Data Collection Process Every time I opened my phone and ran the Shortcut, it automatically: (1) Logged the date and time. (2) Logged my GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude). (3) Asked why I was using my phone (which I then filled in manually). (4) Prompted me to take a photo of my immediate surroundings. (5a) 1/12 of the time: prompted for a video recording. (5b) 1/12 of the time: prompted for an audio recording. (5c) 1/12 of the time: waited 30 seconds, then, if I was still on my phone, prompted a screen recording. 4. Data Processing After a week of collecting data, I standardized the \u201cwhy\u201d column (e.g., \u201ctxt,\u201d \u201ctext,\u201d and \u201cwhatsapp\u201d all categorized under \u201cmessaging\u201d). Then, I uploaded the resulting data to Google My Maps , where each pin on the map represents an instance of phone use. The pins are color coded by the reason I opened my phone. Here is a summary of how many times I used my phone for each category: The URL at the bottom of each pin is a photo of what my surroundings looked like when my attention went to my phone. The final map serves as a spatial visualization of attention, showing where and why I used my phone across the week. Feel free to look around! 5. Limitations The shortcut app didn\u2019t always work. Sometimes it just didn\u2019t run (I\u2019m not sure why). It also needed an internet connection to log my coordinates, so whenever I was on the train or in airplane mode it either didn\u2019t work or was delayed. Sometimes I just forgot to use it. More so at the beginning of the week than toward the end. Because I had to remember to run it each time (being both the researcher and the subject), I\u2019m sure it biased how I used my phone. It definitely wasn\u2019t a perfect reflection of my baseline behavior before the experiment. It only tracked when I opened my phone, not how long I was on it for. Time spent on the phone feels like an important data point, and that wasn\u2019t collected at all. On a similar note, the app only asked why I opened my phone at the start, but sometimes I\u2019d open it to answer a message and then end up doomscrolling Reddit. It would have been better if the shortcut had checked in every 30 seconds or minute to see if I was still on my phone and asked again what I was doing at that point. I also wanted it so that when you click on a pin in the map, the picture I took pops up. It turns out that Google My Maps isn\u2019t really good at that, so I had to live with just keeping a clickable URL. Still, I would\u2019ve liked the UX better if it showed the image inline. 6. Observations I tried to prompt ChatGPT to process the data for me and get behavioral insights around my phone use. Unfortunately, it kept on crashing and I didn\u2019t have the time to run an excel script to parse through the spreadsheet before writing this. I was curious to see if the time of the day had an effect on the reason my attention went to my phone, if any of the reasons led to bursts of using the phone (measured by a lot of pick ups in a short time frame), and if where I was had an effect on what I used the phone for (more specifically, if I used it for different things at home vs at school vs at a train station, etc) I think I\u2019ll go revisit these if I have some free time later. A few observations: I would have really benefitted from the shortcut prompting me every 30-60s after opening my phone to see where my attention had shifted to. There were plenty of times that I opened my phone to send a text and then found myself scrolling Reddit or checking my emails. Messaging, Camera, and Clock accounted for more than 50% of the times my attention went to my phone. I\u2019ve always hated the idea of an apple watch, but I wonder if using it for the clock and messaging functions would keep me off my phone, and thus less likely to start using it for random things. Using my phone to call was one of the lowest on there. That surprised me. Using my phone for \u201cno reason\u201d which also included \u201cbored\u201d was the 5 th most common reason. I wish I was able to track usage after opening because I am curious if it also led to the most random usage afterwards Links and Resources \u00b6 Add your relevant links here: AttentionLogger (v2) Apple Shortcut Google Sheet that feed the Google My Map Conversation with ChatGPT","title":"Design Studio 1 - Context"},{"location":"deliverables/design-studio-1/#design-studio-1-context","text":"","title":"Design Studio 1 - Context"},{"location":"deliverables/design-studio-1/#overview","text":"For one week, I logged every single time that I interacted with my phone in an attempt to get a deeper understanding of my phone as an object of my attention.
