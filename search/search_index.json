Below is an interactive map that serves as a spatial visualization of this, showing where and why I used my phone across the week. Each pin represents an instance of phone use, and the pins are color coded by the reason why I opened my phone. Click the top left toggle to see the color code. The URL at the bottom of each pin is a photo of what my surroundings looked like when my attention went to my phone. Underneath the map is a short video essay I created made entirely of images, videos, audio, and songs that I captured immediately after opening my phone throughout the week. If you hear something, whether it is a random conversation or a bossa nova song, it was playing during a video, an audio recording, or while I was recording my screen. Interactive Map \u00b6 Video Essay \u00b6 Process Documentation \u00b6 1. Context & Motivation Personal observation: I often spend attention on my phone in ways that feel unaligned with how I want to be. The phone functions as both a useful tool and an object of my attention. Often in a way that feels pathological. Research goal: explore my phone as the object of attention through a first-person, data-driven approach. 2. Research Design Approach: 1PP (first-person perspective), where I am both the subject and the researcher. Duration: One week (October 11\u201318, 2025). Method: Self-tracking experiment using a custom iPhone Shortcut to log contextual and intentional data every single time I interacted with my phone, even if it was just to check the time. Tools: iPhone Apple Shortcuts app iCloud (for storing data) Google Sheets (for logging data) Google My Maps (for visualization) ChatGPT (for co-developing the Shortcut, uploading the map, and analyzing data; link to conversation for transparency and process documentation: https://chatgpt.com/share/68f4debd-4e98-8009-9876-495a71378d84 ) 3. Data Collection Process Every time I opened my phone and ran the Shortcut, it automatically: (1) Logged date and time. (2) Logged GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude). (3) Asked why I was using my phone (self-reported intent). (4) Prompted me to take a photo of my immediate surroundings. (5) 1/12 of the time: prompted for a video recording. (6) 1/12 of the time: prompted for an audio recording. (7) 1/12 of the time: waited 30 seconds, then, if I was still on my phone, prompted a screen recording. 4. Data Processing After a week of collecting data, I standardized the \u201cwhy\u201d column (e.g., \u201ctxt,\u201d \u201ctext,\u201d and \u201cwhatsapp\u201d all categorized under \u201cmessaging\u201d). Then I uploaded the resulting data to Google My Maps, where each pin on the map represented an instance of phone use: https://www.google.es/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1Es_1ItoBFE1IKFXyBiMWJW_ZFmYa27k&ll=41.38895722155954%2C2.1959504136691166&z=15 I color coded was used to differentiate categories of \u201cwhy.\u201d The final map served as a spatial visualization of attention, showing where and why I used my phone across the week. 5. Limitations Shortcut app did not always function properly (occasional failed runs for unknown reasons). Required internet connection to log coordinates \u2014 failed or delayed on trains or airplane mode. Manual activation meant I sometimes forgot to run it, especially early in the week. Being both researcher and subject likely biased my behavior; the act of observation changed my phone use patterns. Only logged instances of opening the phone, not duration of use. Lacked data on secondary usage drift (e.g., opening for messaging, then doomscrolling). Future iteration could check in at intervals (30s/1min) to capture evolving intent. Google My Maps limitation: could not display inline images \u2014 only clickable URLs. 6. Observations \u201cMessaging,\u201d \u201cCamera,\u201d and \u201cClock\u201d accounted for over 50% of total interactions. Suggests potential benefit of transferring clock/messaging functions to a wearable (Apple Watch) to reduce random engagement. \u201cCalls\u201d were among the least frequent uses. \u201cNo reason\u201d or \u201cbored\u201d ranked 5 th \u2014 raises questions about spontaneous, unintentional attention use. Tracking follow-up activity could clarify whether these instances led to more scattered usage patterns. Visual Documentation \u00b6 Images \u00b6 Add your images here.
