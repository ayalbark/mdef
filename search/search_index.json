Conceptual Statement This action investigates what happens when navigation is stripped of digital mediation and constrained to a single continuous path. Instead of being guided by algorithms, I submitted my movement to Barcelona\u2019s Avinguda Diagonal, an urban shortcut that, like a navigation app, prioritizes efficiency and straight-line logic. By walking its full 11km length without ever leaving the street, I tested how this highly optimized form of movement shapes my attention, perception, and decision making. Navigation apps offer certainty but flatten experience; they obscure the spontaneous and embodied qualities of both city and self. This d\u00e9rive creates a map of things Google Maps could never tell you, grounding each pin in my own lived sensations rather than commercial establishments, tourist destinations, or other cultural points of interest. Embodied Map of Avinguda Diagonal Audiovisual Essay D\u00e9rive Rules \u00b6 RULE 1: NEVER LEAVE DIAGONAL You may enter spaces that open directly onto Diagonal (shops, lobbies, courtyards), but you must return to Diagonal in the same place. You cannot turn onto another street. You walk Diagonal from end to end as a continuous line. RULE 2: THE DERIVE CONTINUES UNTIL YOU REACH THE OTHER END OF DIAGONAL RULE 3: DO NOT OPEN A NAVIGATION MAP FOR THE ENTIRE DURATION Things to Keep in Mind: - Use your phone as little as possible except using the Shortcut and camera - Move at your natural pace - No optimizing time or speed - Follow your body\u2019s impulses, not logic - Document only when triggered, not constantly DOCUMENTATION RULES: LAYER 1 \u2014 Temporal Anchors Set a timer to go off every 20 minutes. When your timer goes off, trigger the shortcut and record audio describing: - what your attention is on - what sensation is dominant - how your body feels - Take one 10-30 sec video LAYER 2 \u2014 Attention Pull Trigger the shortcut whenever you feel a strong pull. (Optional) Take a 5\u201310 sec close-up video of the thing that pulled you. \u201cStrong Pulls\u201d can be defined as a: A. Sensory pull (examples): - sudden smell - change of temperature - shift in sound - unusual light/shadow - texture you notice B. Emotional pull (examples): - curiosity - unease - comfort - disgust - memory flash C.

When you enter: - Trigger the shortcut - Return directly to Diagonal at the same point ENDING RITUAL When you reach the end of Diagonal do a closing audio note describing: how your attention changed throughout the D\u00e9rive what surprised you during the D\u00e9rive what Diagonal felt like as a continuous line Stop documentation. Let it settle. Ride a bike home and watch the sunset. Reflection \u00b6 My first-person research gave me three big takeaways. 1) I outsource a huge amount of my decisions to Google Maps, especially to reviews written by complete strangers whose tastes might vary wildly from my own, who I\u2019ll likeley never meet. 2) I follow the same digital and physical pathways and architectures over and over again. Following these paths give me a sense of certainty, but feels rigid and comes at the cost of spontaneity and mystery. 3) When I use my phone in these ways, I often end up in a kind of digital intoxication. I lose a sense of myself and feel disembodied. My first action, the social d\u00e9rive, came out of trying to address the first two observations. It was a mix of bringing back a sense of wandering and also humanizing the recommendations I usually search for online. A few things stood out: it\u2019s way easier to look at reviews than to ask people in person, it felt way more uncomfortable to ask a random stranger for a recommendation than to read something online, and doing it in person was more fun but somehow felt less reliable than clicking on a five-start review. My second action was this Diagonal d\u00e9rive. I tried to address the last two observations from my 1pp research. I had been thinking a lot about the power of constraints, so I decided to walk across the entire city while only staying on Avinguda Diagonal. It felt like the right way to flip my earlier 1pp research: instead of logging all the times my phone grabbed my attention, I used the phone to log all the times things in the world grabbed my attention. It was a way to see what happens to my attention when it\u2019s not digitally mediated, but is still shaped by a single fixed rule. I designed the whole protocol to pull my attention back towards my body. The rule of only dropping pins when something pulled me, and the idea of building a counter-map of details you\u2019d never find on Google Maps, were both meant to foreground embodiment. Even the Shortcut was built to be as minimally invasive as possible. All I had to do was tap the phone to log my location and start a voice memo, so I didn\u2019t have to look at the screen and have it become the center of the experience. At the start, my attention felt about 70/30 external to internal. But as the walk went on, I actually became hyper-aware of my internal sensations. That surprised me. I expected to get pulled into tiny architectural details or textures on the sidewalk, but instead I kept noticing parts of my body I don\u2019t normally feel on a walk. Then my attention would swing back outward depending on what was happening around me. By the end, the d\u00e9rive looped directly back into what I learned from my 1pp research, but with a twist. The absurdity of following one 11km street across the whole city let me drop deeper into myself at times, but it also ironed out a lot of the spontaneity I usually crave. It was both grounding and flattening. It reminded me of the way I use my phone: it gives me the quickest route, but it often thins out the experience. Walking Diagonal felt similar: helpful in one sense, limiting in another. There were stretches where the constraint made my surroundings feel alive, and stretches where it boxed me in and I wanted to escape. It made me realize that efficiency is great in doses, but what I want more than anything is room to drift, wander, and let mystery back in. Downloadable Shortcut : Click here!

Toni \u00b6 Four years ago I sat in my living room staring at my mom. Her black and gray mane of hair laid silently with a purple daffodil behind her ear. Four weeks earlier we had been dancing in the same exact room, in the same exact spot, Sans medical equipment and hospital bed. The floor still remembered our steps. And I could see her swaying side to side, Spinning in circles while her dress Tried to keep up. Four years ago I sat wondering if I had ever seen my mom so still. She paraglided over the French Alps. She biked the Great Wall of China. She belly danced through medical school. And here she was, Silent with the weight of death on her eyes, Beautiful as always. Persephone returning to the garden of Hades. Four years ago I sat and prayed that I would never forget the touch of her hand on my shoulder, that I would never forget the sound of her voice echoing through the house, that I would always remember her smile. The further one gets from death the more it feels like a postcard. The more it feels like it came from somewhere far away, by a hand other than your own. With a message written in ink that stains your fingers and the fingers of its author. Every once in a while I take the postcard out of my drawer and stare at it silently. It\u2019s written in a language I can\u2019t understand. On the other side of the postcard is a picture of the waves washing away the shore, and if I look close enough I can see something written in the sand. It\u2019s almost been washed away, but I can still feel the touch of her hand on my shoulder. Ambrosia \u00b6 There is nothing more satisfying than sitting on a chair that is a tree stump on a sandy road in southern Mexico and hearing the machete rain down upon the coconut\u2019s husk while the sun boomerangs its ultraviolet rays at your bare skin covered in drying salt and a sprinkle of sand and you\u2019re handed the cold coconut in exchange for thirty pesos, the last in your pocket, but it doesn\u2019t matter as the sweet juice pours into your open mouth.

Below is an interactive map that serves as a spatial visualization of this, showing where and why I used my phone across the week. Each pin represents an instance of phone use, and the pins are color coded by the reason why I opened my phone. Click the top left toggle to see the color code. The URL at the bottom of each pin is a photo of what my surroundings looked like when my attention went to my phone. Underneath the map is a short video essay I created made entirely of images, videos, audio, and songs that I captured immediately after opening my phone throughout the week. If you hear something, whether it is a random conversation or a bossa nova song, it was playing during a video, an audio recording, or while I was recording my screen. Interactive Map \u00b6 Video Essay \u00b6 Process Documentation \u00b6 1. Context & Motivation In the Design Studio 1 course we were given this prompt: Choose a context of interest (socio-bio-techno-political, both physical and/or digital, etc.). Develop a site-specific research methodology to study this context from a 1PP approach. Develop an audiovisual essay (90s), showing 50 images of your 1PP research defining the field of action of your context of interest * Explain your methodology: how, where, why I had started that class by sharing this design bet: \u201cOpen-source, 3D-printed biofeedback devices for at-home attention training could increase attention span and sustained focus by 200% without medical intervention\u201d. I didn\u2019t feel attached to the design bet, but using attention as my starting point I decided to explore the link between my attention and my phone. I feel like how I attend to my phone feels unaligned with how I want to be attending to my phone. My phone functions as a useful tool, but also as a black hole, sucking in my attention when I would rather it be elsewhere. My research goal was to explore my phone as and object of my attention through a first-person, data-driven approach. 2. Research Design Approach: 1PP (first-person perspective), where I was both the subject and the researcher. Duration: One week (October 11\u201318, 2025). Method: Self-tracking experiment using a custom iPhone Shortcut to log contextual and intentional data every single time I interacted with my phone, even if it was just to check the time. Tools I Used: iPhone Apple Shortcuts app Attention Logger (the shortcut I created to collect the data) iCloud (for storing data) Google Sheets (for logging data) Google My Maps (for visualization) ChatGPT (for co-developing Attention Logger, uploading the map, and analyzing data) Link to the conversation is in the \u201cLinks and Resources\u201d section at the bottom of the page. 3. Data Collection Process Every time I opened my phone and ran the Shortcut, it automatically: (1) Logged the date and time. (2) Logged my GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude). (3) Asked why I was using my phone (which I then filled in manually). (4) Prompted me to take a photo of my immediate surroundings. (5a) 1/12 of the time: prompted for a video recording. (5b) 1/12 of the time: prompted for an audio recording. (5c) 1/12 of the time: waited 30 seconds, then, if I was still on my phone, prompted a screen recording. 4. Data Processing After a week of collecting data, I standardized the \u201cwhy\u201d column (e.g., \u201ctxt,\u201d \u201ctext,\u201d and \u201cwhatsapp\u201d all categorized under \u201cmessaging\u201d). Then, I uploaded the resulting data to Google My Maps , where each pin on the map represents an instance of phone use. The pins are color coded by the reason I opened my phone. Here is a summary of how many times I used my phone for each category: The URL at the bottom of each pin is a photo of what my surroundings looked like when my attention went to my phone. The final map serves as a spatial visualization of attention, showing where and why I used my phone across the week. Feel free to look around! 5. Limitations The shortcut app didn\u2019t always work. Sometimes it just didn\u2019t run (I\u2019m not sure why). It also needed an internet connection to log my coordinates, so whenever I was on the train or in airplane mode it either didn\u2019t work or was delayed. Sometimes I just forgot to use it. More so at the beginning of the week than toward the end. Because I had to remember to run it each time (being both the researcher and the subject), I\u2019m sure it biased how I used my phone. It definitely wasn\u2019t a perfect reflection of my baseline behavior before the experiment. It only tracked when I opened my phone, not how long I was on it for. Time spent on the phone feels like an important data point, and that wasn\u2019t collected at all. On a similar note, the app only asked why I opened my phone at the start, but sometimes I\u2019d open it to answer a message and then end up doomscrolling Reddit. It would have been better if the shortcut had checked in every 30 seconds or minute to see if I was still on my phone and asked again what I was doing at that point. I also wanted it so that when you click on a pin in the map, the picture I took pops up. It turns out that Google My Maps isn\u2019t really good at that, so I had to live with just keeping a clickable URL. Still, I would\u2019ve liked the UX better if it showed the image inline. 6.

Context & Motivation In the Design Studio 1 course we were given this prompt: Choose a context of interest (socio-bio-techno-political, both physical and/or digital, etc.). Develop a site-specific research methodology to study this context from a 1PP approach. Develop an audiovisual essay (90s), showing 50 images of your 1PP research defining the field of action of your context of interest * Explain your methodology: how, where, why I had started that class by sharing this design bet: \u201cOpen-source, 3D-printed biofeedback devices for at-home attention training could increase attention span and sustained focus by 200% without medical intervention\u201d. I didn\u2019t feel attached to the design bet, but using attention as my starting point I decided to explore the link between my attention and my phone. I feel like how I attend to my phone feels unaligned with how I want to be attending to my phone. My phone functions as a useful tool, but also as a black hole, sucking in my attention when I would rather it be elsewhere. My research goal was to explore my phone as and object of my attention through a first-person, data-driven approach. 2. Research Design Approach: 1PP (first-person perspective), where I was both the subject and the researcher. Duration: One week (October 11\u201318, 2025). Method: Self-tracking experiment using a custom iPhone Shortcut to log contextual and intentional data every single time I interacted with my phone, even if it was just to check the time. Tools I Used: iPhone Apple Shortcuts app Attention Logger (the shortcut I created to collect the data) iCloud (for storing data) Google Sheets (for logging data) Google My Maps (for visualization) ChatGPT (for co-developing Attention Logger, uploading the map, and analyzing data) Link to the conversation is in the \u201cLinks and Resources\u201d section at the bottom of the page. 3. Data Collection Process Every time I opened my phone and ran the Shortcut, it automatically: (1) Logged the date and time. (2) Logged my GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude). (3) Asked why I was using my phone (which I then filled in manually). (4) Prompted me to take a photo of my immediate surroundings. (5a) 1/12 of the time: prompted for a video recording. (5b) 1/12 of the time: prompted for an audio recording. (5c) 1/12 of the time: waited 30 seconds, then, if I was still on my phone, prompted a screen recording. 4. Data Processing After a week of collecting data, I standardized the \u201cwhy\u201d column (e.g., \u201ctxt,\u201d \u201ctext,\u201d and \u201cwhatsapp\u201d all categorized under \u201cmessaging\u201d). Then, I uploaded the resulting data to Google My Maps , where each pin on the map represents an instance of phone use. The pins are color coded by the reason I opened my phone. Here is a summary of how many times I used my phone for each category: The URL at the bottom of each pin is a photo of what my surroundings looked like when my attention went to my phone. The final map serves as a spatial visualization of attention, showing where and why I used my phone across the week. Feel free to look around! 5. Limitations The shortcut app didn\u2019t always work. Sometimes it just didn\u2019t run (I\u2019m not sure why). It also needed an internet connection to log my coordinates, so whenever I was on the train or in airplane mode it either didn\u2019t work or was delayed. Sometimes I just forgot to use it. More so at the beginning of the week than toward the end. Because I had to remember to run it each time (being both the researcher and the subject), I\u2019m sure it biased how I used my phone. It definitely wasn\u2019t a perfect reflection of my baseline behavior before the experiment. It only tracked when I opened my phone, not how long I was on it for. Time spent on the phone feels like an important data point, and that wasn\u2019t collected at all. On a similar note, the app only asked why I opened my phone at the start, but sometimes I\u2019d open it to answer a message and then end up doomscrolling Reddit. It would have been better if the shortcut had checked in every 30 seconds or minute to see if I was still on my phone and asked again what I was doing at that point. I also wanted it so that when you click on a pin in the map, the picture I took pops up. It turns out that Google My Maps isn\u2019t really good at that, so I had to live with just keeping a clickable URL. Still, I would\u2019ve liked the UX better if it showed the image inline. 6.

Coming from a medical-adjacent background, I was excited to expand on these and dive into a biomedical discussion of prosthetics. As you can imagine, I was surprised when we began on the first day and skipped the biomedical discussion altogether. The first examples we were given were prostheses to avoid surveillance: ways to trick facial recognition softwares, prostheses that allow you to use Apple Face ID without showing your face, and small coverings for your tongue, ears, fingers, etc. Even though they weren\u2019t biomedical applications, they were close enough that I was able to follow along without feeling any conceptual whiplash. But then we got to hairstyles, and that\u2019s when everything started to shatter. I had never thought about hairstyles as a type of prosthesis, more of a type of personal expression. Choosing a hairstyle felt closer to choosing what color to paint your room than choosing a cochlear implant to restore hearing. But as the conversation progressed, I started to change my mind. It\u2019s true that hairstyles aren\u2019t purely aesthetic. Different hairstyles have different physical functions: short hair can keep you cool in the summer, long hair can keep you warm in the winter. But hairstyles also serve non-physical functions. Different styles can signal in-group or out-group membership, age, trade, even religion. A shaved head on a soldier means something completely different than on a cancer patient. Dreadlocks can carry cultural, spiritual, or ancestral meaning. Even subtle choices like gray hair left natural, or brown hair dyed blonde send signals about belonging and self-expression. Hairstyles tell people who you are, or at least who you want to be seen as. There\u2019s weird this overlap between function and aesthetic in which hairstyles both do something for you and socially signal something about you. At first, I thought that this might have been the most concept-shifting moment of the week, but it turned out to be only the beginning. As the conversation progressed we started to argue about what else could count as a prosthesis. Are clothes prostheses? Shoes? Earrings? I had never heard them described that way before, but it started to make sense for the same reasons that hair made sense. They might not serve medical functions, but they perform physical, psychological, and social ones. They make you feel different, act different, and influence how people interact with you. Right as I thought my brain had finally adapted to accept this new concept, the conversation became even more confusing. Some people started to argue that depending on the situation, prostheses could include objects like phones, cars, tables, chairs, even hammers. I loudly objected \u201cNot everything can be a prosthesis!\u201d I had to draw the line somewhere. But unfortunately for me, the conversation continued, and my concept of prostheses continued to change along with it. Even though phones and cars are completely different from any of my bodily parts, they do enhance and change how I function in the world. My phone completely changes how I exist in the world. It extends my memory, my communication, even my sense of direction. I don\u2019t have to remember phone numbers anymore; my phone does it for me. When I\u2019m lost, it becomes my compass. When I\u2019m lonely, it becomes a portal to connection. I even catch myself reaching for it in my pocket when it isn\u2019t there, like some weird type of phantom limb. In that sense my phone is a cognitive prosthesis, extending not my limbs but my memory, orientation, and social reach. The same goes for cars. When I\u2019m driving I feel the car\u2019s edges; I move as if its body is mine. Every time I drive a car for the first time there is a weird calibration limbo where my body schema needs to expand to properly fit its edges. What\u2019s important to note is that the car only becomes an extension of me when I\u2019m the one driving. As a passenger that connection disappears. Chairs and hammers are trickier. I wasn\u2019t fully convinced that they are prostheses. Most of the time they feel like pure tools, but it\u2019s true that there are moments where they melt into me. When I\u2019m working at a desk for hours, my body and the chair I\u2019m using start to form one continuous system. I stop noticing where one ends and the other begins. It feels as if I am touching the ground, even though it\u2019s the chair, not me. With a hammer, it\u2019s even more dynamic. The first few swings tend to feel awkward, like there\u2019s a delay between my intention and the nail\u2019s response. But after a while, my arm and the hammer sync up and I start to \u201cfeel\u201d the nail through the metal. I could be convinced that at that moment the hammer shifts from tool to prosthesis. I started to feel like there are different kinds of prostheses: functional, aesthetic, a blend of the two, and prosthetic tools: tools that are sometimes tools and sometimes prostheses. Glasses, hearing aids, phones, earrings, and clothing are all some mixture of functional and aesthetic. Hammers, cars, chairs, and maybe even laptops feel more tool-like. At the end of the first day the real question for me became: what is the line between tool and prosthesis? That question is still with me now two weeks later. We never defined exactly what a prosthesis is or isn\u2019t, but I want to take a stab at it, mostly because I think it leads to interesting conversation and debate. Prosthesis (noun): anything that merges with your body or identity in a way that changes how you perceive, behave, or are perceived. - Ayal I like this definition because it explains why something can shift from being a tool to being a prosthesis. It\u2019s not just about what the object is, but about how you relate to it in a given moment. It depends on the degree to which your body or mind has folded it into your sense of self. The same object can sit on a table one moment and live inside your perception the next. That weird capacity for a thing to become part of you one moment, then stop being part of you the next moment, led me to start thinking about what I\u2019m calling the prosthetic state. A prosthetic state is a temporary and dynamic condition in which an object becomes integrated into your bodily or cognitive system so fully that it shapes how you sense, think, or act. The prosthesis and the self merge for a moment, then separate again when your attention, context, or environment shifts. My bike, for example, isn\u2019t a prosthesis when it\u2019s just leaning against the wall. It\u2019s an inert aluminum frame with two wheels and some grease on the chain. But the moment I climb onto it, something changes. I start to feel the road through the tires, to sense tiny shifts in balance or traction as if they were happening inside my own body. I can tell when the air pressure is low or when the brakes are too tight, not because I\u2019m thinking about it, but because my body and the bike have synced. That moment is a prosthetic state: a temporary fusion where the bike isn\u2019t just a tool, it\u2019s a part of me\u2026 and it\u2019s also the closest I\u2019ll ever get to being a satyr.","title":"Reflection Piece"},{"location":"deliverables/living-with-your-own-ideas-reflection/#living-with-your-own-ideas-reflection-piece","text":"Prosthesis (noun): an artificial device to replace or augment a missing or impaired part of the body. - Merriam-Webster Living with Your Own Ideas was a fascinating course.

Every time I drive a car for the first time there is a weird calibration limbo where my body schema needs to expand to properly fit its edges. What\u2019s important to note is that the car only becomes an extension of me when I\u2019m the one driving. As a passenger that connection disappears. Chairs and hammers are trickier. I wasn\u2019t fully convinced that they are prostheses. Most of the time they feel like pure tools, but it\u2019s true that there are moments where they melt into me. When I\u2019m working at a desk for hours, my body and the chair I\u2019m using start to form one continuous system. I stop noticing where one ends and the other begins. It feels as if I am touching the ground, even though it\u2019s the chair, not me. With a hammer, it\u2019s even more dynamic. The first few swings tend to feel awkward, like there\u2019s a delay between my intention and the nail\u2019s response. But after a while, my arm and the hammer sync up and I start to \u201cfeel\u201d the nail through the metal. I could be convinced that at that moment the hammer shifts from tool to prosthesis. I started to feel like there are different kinds of prostheses: functional, aesthetic, a blend of the two, and prosthetic tools: tools that are sometimes tools and sometimes prostheses. Glasses, hearing aids, phones, earrings, and clothing are all some mixture of functional and aesthetic. Hammers, cars, chairs, and maybe even laptops feel more tool-like. At the end of the first day the real question for me became: what is the line between tool and prosthesis? That question is still with me now two weeks later. We never defined exactly what a prosthesis is or isn\u2019t, but I want to take a stab at it, mostly because I think it leads to interesting conversation and debate. Prosthesis (noun): anything that merges with your body or identity in a way that changes how you perceive, behave, or are perceived. - Ayal I like this definition because it explains why something can shift from being a tool to being a prosthesis. It\u2019s not just about what the object is, but about how you relate to it in a given moment. It depends on the degree to which your body or mind has folded it into your sense of self. The same object can sit on a table one moment and live inside your perception the next. That weird capacity for a thing to become part of you one moment, then stop being part of you the next moment, led me to start thinking about what I\u2019m calling the prosthetic state. A prosthetic state is a temporary and dynamic condition in which an object becomes integrated into your bodily or cognitive system so fully that it shapes how you sense, think, or act. The prosthesis and the self merge for a moment, then separate again when your attention, context, or environment shifts. My bike, for example, isn\u2019t a prosthesis when it\u2019s just leaning against the wall. It\u2019s an inert aluminum frame with two wheels and some grease on the chain. But the moment I climb onto it, something changes. I start to feel the road through the tires, to sense tiny shifts in balance or traction as if they were happening inside my own body. I can tell when the air pressure is low or when the brakes are too tight, not because I\u2019m thinking about it, but because my body and the bike have synced. That moment is a prosthetic state: a temporary fusion where the bike isn\u2019t just a tool, it\u2019s a part of me\u2026 and it\u2019s also the closest I\u2019ll ever get to being a satyr.","title":"Living With Your Own Ideas - Reflection Piece"},{"location":"project/project/","text":"Initial ideas \u00b6 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
